            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>VendoPage was created to solve a simple problem: sellers were losing sales because their WhatsApp stories expired after 24 hours.</p>
            
            <p>Small business owners spent hours reposting products daily, only to watch them disappear. Customers couldn't find items they saw yesterday, and sales were lost.</p>
            
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>We help small businesses showcase their products permanently, making it easier for customers to discover and buy.</p>
            
            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>VendoPage gives you a permanent catalog. No more daily uploads, no more lost sales. Just one simple link to share everywhere.</p>
